# What is the Port ?

A port is a tunnel that uses the TCP or UDP protocol. The port is connected to a host, server, or IP address to view and control connections (C2).

# What is the difference between tcp and udp ?

1. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
Reliable: Ensures data arrives correctly and in order, using an acknowledgment (ACK) mechanism and retransmission in case of data loss.
Connection-Oriented: Requires establishing a connection between the sender and receiver before data is transmitted (such as a three-way handshake).
Relatively slow: Due to data validation and retransmission of lost data.
Used in applications that require accuracy and data loss prevention, such as:
Web browsing (HTTP, HTTPS)
Email (SMTP, IMAP, POP3)
File transfer (FTP, SFTP)

2. UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
Unreliable: Data is not guaranteed to arrive, as it is sent without confirmation of receipt.
Connectionless: It does not require a connection to be established before transmission, making it faster.
Lightweight and faster than TCP because it does not use verification and retransmission mechanisms.
It is used in applications that require rapid response time rather than high fidelity, such as:
Live video and audio streaming (YouTube, Netflix, VoIP)
Online gaming
DNS services (for translating domain names into IP addresses)
